# RIT Routes
## Project Statement
### We at Tiger Consulting, came together to make an application to help the RIT community during these troubling times. This   application is called RIT Routes. The goal of this project is to create a better functioning version of the RIT Maps, with some additional features to help with safety, navigation, and convenience. Should this venture be successful, RIT students and faculty will be able to choose different routes based on both efficiency and traffic.
### The RIT Routes Project is designed to help students navigate the campus so that they can easily get to their destination, while avoiding crowded areas. Functionalities would include live updates on the map for traffic, construction and events, as well as a way to contact public safety directly from the application itself. The application will also allow functionality for viewing hours for restaurants, food trucks every weekend, and built-in connectivity to a student's class schedule. We want this product to be more than just a map, but a central location for students to find all the information they need throughout the day.


### This is only an example of what it would look like.
